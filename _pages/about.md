I am currently (last updated - Feb. 2021) a PDRA in the [MTG](https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/) in the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy. I work on first-principles design of inorganic materials and am also interested in experimental construction of electrochemical energy storage devices. Currently, I focus on (/am hired to do) the computational design and characterization of cathode materials and interfaces for lithium-based batteries.
