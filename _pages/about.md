I am a PDRA in the [MTG](https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/) in the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy at University of Cambridge. (last updated - Feb. 2021) I work on first-principles design of inorganic materials and am also interested in experimental construction of electrochemical energy storage devices. Currently, I focus on (am hired to work on) computational design and characterization of cathode materials and interfaces for lithium-based batteries.
